# ByNameModding-IL2CPP
 BNM-IL2CPP is a opensource library that is used to work with IL2CPP methods using C++. Based on some repos like Aetherim, IL2CPPResolver. I made it for working without IL2CPP structures and cuz i dont like syntax of other tools that work with IL2CPP.


so pls don't say smth like "it's shit u're don't know C++" it's my first C++ work and i don't know some language aspects that can make work better
if you want you can correct me via issues
